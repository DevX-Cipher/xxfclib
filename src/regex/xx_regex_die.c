/* Work budget for one isArchiveRecordPresentExp call.
 *
 * xx_regex_exec caps the backtracking of a single match, but the cap is per
 * subject: an archive with many long entry names multiplies it, and the
 * total grows with the entry count without limit. Measured against the
 * Obfuscapk pattern over 64 KB names: 8.6 s for 40 entries, 32 s for 200,
 * and on from there in proportion to the entry count.
 *
 * The regular expression engine reports no step count, so a budget over the
 * expensive names can only be wall clock, and a wall-clock budget must never
 * be what decides whether a name matches: the same file would answer
 * differently on a different machine, or on the same machine twice. A plain
 * deadline over the whole walk does exactly that - with 6 crafted names in
 * front of a matching one, cdie answered "detected" on some runs and "not
 * detected" on others, where the reference always answers "detected".
 *
 * So the walk goes over the short names first, with no budget at all. Every
 * name a real archive holds is short - a ZIP entry name is a path, and paths
 * stop at PATH_MAX - so for real input the second pass has nothing to do and
 * the answer is exactly the reference's, whatever the machine. Only names
 * longer than any path, which is to say only names that were built to be
 * slow, are left to the deadline, and only when the short names produced no
 * match.                                                                    */
