/**
 * @file xx_thread_pool.h
 * @brief Fixed-size worker pool with a FIFO task queue.
 *
 * Uses xx_threads primitives, including semaphores rather than condition
 * variables, so the Windows backend also supports Windows XP without a CRT.
 * Submission, statistics and idle waits may run concurrently. Shutdown calls
 * must be serialized by the owner. Destroy requires exclusive ownership: no
 * other client may use the handle once destruction starts. Running callbacks
 * may still submit work (which is rejected after shutdown) or query statistics.
