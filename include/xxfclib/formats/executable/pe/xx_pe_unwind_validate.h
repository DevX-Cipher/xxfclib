/* The AMD64 exception directory's own statement of where each function begins

 *
 * Reads at most capacity entries into functions and reports the number the
 * directory describes in *total, so a caller can size its own array and read
 * again. A trailing all-zero record ends the table, as some linkers pad it.
 *
 * Each entry also carries what its UNWIND_INFO declares: the flags, the
 * prologue's length, the frame register where one is established, the bytes
 * the prologue allocates, and -- for a chained entry -- the primary entry it
 * continues. A chained entry describes a *part* of a function rather than a
 * function of its own, which a caller walking the table as a function list
 * must account for; primary_begin_rva follows the chain to the entry that
 * does begin the function. Where the unwind data is not readable, unwind_read
 * is 0 and those fields are zero rather than guessed; begin and end still
 * state what the directory says.
 *
 * device offsets must be relative to the same PE image as pe->map. Neither the
 * device cursor nor the inspection is changed. Returns 1 when the directory
 * was read, 0 when it is absent, not file-backed, or malformed (an entry whose
 * end does not follow its begin). This reports what the table says; use
 * xx_pe_inspect_validate_amd64_unwind to judge whether it is well formed. */
