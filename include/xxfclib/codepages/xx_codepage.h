/* Stateless character codecs. Callbacks consume/produce one Unicode scalar.
 * On error consumed/written is zero and the output scalar/buffer is unchanged.
 * Truncated input is distinguished from malformed input. Descriptors are
 * immutable and may be shared between threads; applications may supply their
 * own descriptor and callbacks. Use xx_codepage_decode/encode to validate
 * arguments before dispatching a callback. Callbacks receive nonempty input
 * and valid Unicode scalars respectively. UTF-16/32 use explicit byte order;
 * BOMs are returned as U+FEFF, and no platform locale is consulted. No allocation or platform runtime is needed. */
